# DogeForces

Of course, everyone loves Doge. That is why this Google Chrome extension changes Codeforces to DogeForces. Here is a screenshot:

## Functionalities:

- *Everyone* is now red (even admin / users who haven't participated).
- *Everyone* has high rating, high contribution (at least in profile page).

Of course, functionalities of Codeforces still work.

## How to install:

1. Clone my code.
2. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions) and tick on "Developer mode".
3. Click on "Load unpacked extension..." and select main folder.
4. Load Codeforces, and wait for a while for the extension to work.
